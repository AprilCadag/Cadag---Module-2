# Cadag--Module-2
This Solidity program serves as a basic example to introduce beginners to Solidity syntax and common patterns. It illustrates the usage of state variables, constructor, functions, and error handling mechanisms. 

## Description
This is a simplified Ethereum wallet interface, allowing users to interact with their MetaMask or similar wallet. It manages user state, including account address and balance, and facilitates actions like connecting the wallet, depositing and withdrawing Ether from a smart contract. The rendering includes basic UI elements such as account information and buttons for transactions, with minimal styling applied for presentation.
